# Documentation Package: Extended. Wpf. Toolkit
A package that improves and extends the existing WPF components while also adding new ones.

### Implementation:
We chose this package so that we could use a DateTimePicker component in our WPF FormWindows windows.
WPF currently only support a DatePicker and not a DateTimePicker.

### Reasoning:
We found that using this package would be a greater benefit than writing a new control from scratch.
